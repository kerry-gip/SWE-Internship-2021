1. Want to grow as a proper developer

Working with leveraged(centralized) teams that works on specific products
ex teams that support the entire company (DBA team, firewall team, security)
work on branding, establishing relationships with people that I can grow with 
Update 3/10 

I know who to contact when I have questions regarding specific parts of my projects (paula, keith, sunmeet)
- know full end to end software lifecyle 

2. Develop good working habits 

For the team - teamwork, communications
For self - be effective in my work
Understand commercial practices/standards (Delta Contract Renewal) - Project Halted
Update 3/10

I think now I know how to search what I don't know and with my days being split where I do most of my work T/TH, it's a lot easier for me to just go off on a topic and figure it out vs trying to get as much done in 4 hours and having to switch gears and go to class
Spam saurabh when I finish what I said I was going to do and what I will do next
he'll thumbs up me 
Forgot commercial practices/standards lol that project has been halted 


3. Communication

Solicit regular feedback to ensure I'm on the right path instead of waiting on the regular meetings 
Take advantage of end of iteration demos 
make sure I am effective in my short demo speech and get key points across 
make sure I am connected on vpn  

Update 3/10

I let saurabh know what ive gotten done and what my next plans are 
Demo's are fine, just need to remember talking points and difference between last iteration demo and next one

4. Staying organized - New 3/10

Becoming increasingly forgetful so I started writing things down more
